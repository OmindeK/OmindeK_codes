# OmindeK_codes
I analyze data obtained from mosquito molecular and genomics assays. Currently focused on Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus mosquito species. Ready to learn newly developed codes or combine effort with github family to develop new codes for performing genomics, NGS and survival analysis in mosquito, ticks and other vector work.
